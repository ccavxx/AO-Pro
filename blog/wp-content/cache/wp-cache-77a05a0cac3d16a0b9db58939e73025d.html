<p id="top" /><p><img alt="" src="http://aoproductions.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/wardance.jpg" style="float: left;" /></p>
<p><strong>War Dance</strong>// Thursday May 22 (tonight), 7PM and 10PM // Free at Swift room 107</p>
<p>Academy Award Nominee for Best Documentary Feature</p>
<blockquote>Sean Fine and Andrea Nix Fine&#8217;s WAR DANCE is a powerful documentary that follows a group of schoolchildren as they overcome nearly insurmountable odds in their quest to participate in the annual Kampala Music Festival. For over 20 years, Northern Uganda has been a war zone, and as a vicious rebel force, the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army, has run rampant, destroying villages, kidnapping children, and murdering parents. The 60,000 survivors are forced to live in a refugee camp, where conditions are bleak and resources are scarce. Somehow, the children of the Patongo Primary School have qualified for the Kampala Music Festival competition for the first time, a feat unto itself; yet these children are determined to take home the championship prize. As they make their way to Kampala to perform in front of an audience that doesn&#8217;t think much of them, they must band together to prove that war and famine and slaughter cannot suffocate their spirit.</blockquote>

The Lion King? Sing along? Yeah, that&#8217;s right. Belt out &quot;Nants ingonyama bagithi baba&quot; with Rafiki (&quot;Circle of Life&quot;, anyone?) or just chill on the lawn and enjoy this Disney classic for the self-conscious tone deaf. No matter what, the Lion King is sure to bring you back to the good ol&#8217; grade school days when you still believed in Hakuna Matata. Lion nuzzling is encouraged but not condoned.</font><font color="#000000"><big> </big></font></p></div>

<h2 style="clear:both;">A&#038;O Spring Alumni Speaker this Thursday!</h2>
<p id="top" /><h3>Christine Hassler</h3>
<h4>Northwestern Alumna</h4>
<h4>Author of <cite>&ldquo;20 Something, 20 Everything&rdquo;</cite></h4>
<p>Faced with a career she worked hard to achieve but didn&rsquo;t like and the disintegration of her relationship, author Christine Hassler started talking to other twenty-something women and discovered a pattern. Many women in their twenties (and thirties) feel unsettled and struggle to reassess their positions on what Christine calls the twenties triangle: Who am I? What do I want? How do I get it?</p>
<p>Come listen to Christine speak about these questions and answer your own about her experiences as a Hollywood agent, author, and NU and Kappa Alpha Theta Alum.</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">No Country for Old Men &amp; The Savages</h2>
<p id="top" /><p><font size="2" color="#000000"><strong><img width="212" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="140" align="left" alt="" src="http://blogs.indiewire.com/twhalliii/NoCountryForOldMen3.jpg" />No Country for Old Men </strong>// </font><font size="2" color="#000000">Friday April 25 &amp; Saturday April 26, 7PM and 10PM // $3 in McCormick Auditorium<strong><br />
</strong><br />
The Coen brothers make their finest thriller since Fargo with a restrained adaptation of Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s novel. Not that there aren&#8217;t moments of intense violence, but No Country for Old Men is their quietest, most existential film yet. In this modern-day Western, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a Vietnam vet who could use a break. He finds a case filled with $2 million and Moss takes it with him and hits the road only to discover he&#8217;s being followed by ex-special ops agent Chigurh (an eerily calm Javier Bardem). Like the taciturn terminator, No Country for Old Men doesn&#8217;t move quickly, but the tension never dissipates. <br />

</font><font size="2"><br />
</font><font size="2" color="#000000"> Jon (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Wendy Savage (Laura Linney) are two siblings who have spent their adult years trying to recover from the memory of their abusive father. Suddenly, a call comes in that Lenny&rsquo;s girlfriend has died and he cannot care for himself. Despite the fact Jon and Wendy have not spoken to Lenny for twenty years, the Savage siblings feel obliged to take care of him. As Wendy and Jon struggle to make some kind of peace with their difficult father, watching these wonderfully understated yet compelling actors is a pleasure unto itself.</font></p></div>

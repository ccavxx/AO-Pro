		<content type="html" xml:base="http://aoproductions.net/blog/?p=74"><![CDATA[<p id="top" />To whom it may concern,At A&amp;O Productions, we pride ourselves on our tradition of providing quality campus-wide programming throughout the school year. We are always trying to cater to the tastes of our audience&#8211; the students of Northwestern University&#8211;and hope to deliver popular but diverse events. Unfortunately, this year&#8217;s &#8220;Porn at Tech,&#8221; the annual post-Dillo Day event sponsored by A&amp;O, was a departure from our high standards.&#8221;Porn at Tech&#8221; has always been intended to be a tongue-in-cheek, light-hearted event and an opportunity for students to relax a bit after the day&#8217;s festivities. Traditionally, the movie choices have been comedic or ridiculous, and not intended to be taken seriously.  Unfortunately this year we made the mistake of not screening the chosen film before showing it to a public audience, which not only resulted in a presentation with themes, scenes, and situations that some found to be offensive, but set a bad precedent for the future.Because several of the inappropriate scenes contained material relating to human trafficking and abuse, A&amp;O has decided to donate all of the proceeds from the event to One Voice, the student organization dedicated to supporting a global end to these important issues. A&amp;O is proud to continue our relationship with One Voice, with whom we co-sponsored the &#8220;Stop Human Trafficking&#8221; benefit concert featuring the band Stars earlier this past spring.A&amp;O would like extend our apologies to anyone who was offended by the selection, and offer our reassurance that should we decide to continue this popular event, we will establish specific standards and thoroughly screen the chosen films as to avoid situations like these, in addition to making sure that the content and price of the event are well-advertised beforehand. Also, we would like to make clear that events like &#8220;Porn in Tech&#8221; are not funded by the Student Activities Fee, but are paid for out of a separate A&amp;O account which contains discretionary money made up of revenues from our other events.Again, our apologies and reassurances go out to all of those offended, and we hope that everyone is looking forward to the upcoming year of top-notch programming from A&amp;O Productions.Sincerely,Syd CohenChairperson, A&amp;O ProductionsKatie Halpern and Barry McCardelCo-Chairs of Promotions and Public Relations, A&amp;O Productions]]></content>

<p><strong>War Dance</strong>// Thursday May 22 (tonight), 7PM and 10PM // Free at Swift room 107</p>
<p>Academy Award Nominee for Best Documentary Feature</p>
<blockquote>Sean Fine and Andrea Nix Fine&#8217;s WAR DANCE is a powerful documentary that follows a group of schoolchildren as they overcome nearly insurmountable odds in their quest to participate in the annual Kampala Music Festival. For over 20 years, Northern Uganda has been a war zone, and as a vicious rebel force, the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army, has run rampant, destroying villages, kidnapping children, and murdering parents. The 60,000 survivors are forced to live in a refugee camp, where conditions are bleak and resources are scarce. Somehow, the children of the Patongo Primary School have qualified for the Kampala Music Festival competition for the first time, a feat unto itself; yet these children are determined to take home the championship prize. As they make their way to Kampala to perform in front of an audience that doesn&#8217;t think much of them, they must band together to prove that war and famine and slaughter cannot suffocate their spirit.</blockquote>

</strong><br />
The Coen brothers make their finest thriller since Fargo with a restrained adaptation of Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s novel. Not that there aren&#8217;t moments of intense violence, but No Country for Old Men is their quietest, most existential film yet. In this modern-day Western, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a Vietnam vet who could use a break. He finds a case filled with $2 million and Moss takes it with him and hits the road only to discover he&#8217;s being followed by ex-special ops agent Chigurh (an eerily calm Javier Bardem). Like the taciturn terminator, No Country for Old Men doesn&#8217;t move quickly, but the tension never dissipates. <br />

</font><font size="2" color="#000000"> Jon (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Wendy Savage (Laura Linney) are two siblings who have spent their adult years trying to recover from the memory of their abusive father. Suddenly, a call comes in that Lenny&rsquo;s girlfriend has died and he cannot care for himself. Despite the fact Jon and Wendy have not spoken to Lenny for twenty years, the Savage siblings feel obliged to take care of him. As Wendy and Jon struggle to make some kind of peace with their difficult father, watching these wonderfully understated yet compelling actors is a pleasure unto itself.</font></p>]]></content>
